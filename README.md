# Seavor

Seavor is not an existing English word. It is a coined brand name. It can be interpreted as a blend of several English associations:

- sea – symbolizing depth, exploration, and a journey
- savor – meaning to enjoy or appreciate something deeply, suggesting a high-quality, immersive learning experience
- a phonetic resemblance to sailor, subtly evoking navigation and mastery at sea
